This directly addresses the problem statement, which requires the sum of two integers A and B.\n\n#### Handling of Input Structure\n\nThe function expects `input_data` to be a list of lists, with the first sublist containing the two values to be summed. The code accesses `input_data[0][0]` and `input_data[0][1]`, which is consistent with the described input format. This approach is robust as long as the input adheres to the specified structure.\n\n#### Output Format\n\nThe result is returned as a nested list: `[[result]]`. This matches the required output format, ensuring compatibility with the system's expectations for both single-value and multi-value outputs.\n\n#### Error Handling\n\nThe function assumes that the input is well-formed (i.e., the first sublist contains at least two elements, and both can be converted to integers). There is no explicit error handling for malformed input or conversion errors. However, given the problem constraints and the context of competitive programming, this is acceptable unless otherwise specified.\n\n#### Efficiency\n\nThe function performs a constant number of operations (two conversions and one addition), ensuring execution well within the required time constraints, even for the largest possible inputs.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe solution is mathematically correct, adheres to the required input and output formats, and is efficient. It is suitable for the problem as stated.\n\n#### Solution Code\n\n<code>\ndef main_function(input_data: list[list[int | str]]):\n    a = int(input_data[0][0])\n    b = int(input_data[0][1])\n    result = a + b\n    return [[result]]\n</code>",
