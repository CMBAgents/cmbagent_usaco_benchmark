    "content": "**Code Explanation:**\n\nThe provided Python code defines a function main_function that takes a list of lists, input_data, as its argument. This structure represents data read from a file, where each inner list corresponds to a line. The function is designed to solve the problem of summing two integers. It assumes the two integers, A and B, are located in the first inner list of input_data. The function extracts these two values, converts them to integers, calculates their sum, and then returns the result formatted as a nested list, [[sum]], to adhere to the specified output format.\n\nThe function includes a detailed docstring which explains its purpose, the expected input, and the format of the returned output.\n\n**Python Code:**\n\n```python\n# filename: codebase/main_function.py\ndef main_function(input_data: list[list[int | str]]):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the sum of two integers from the input data.\n\n    The function expects the input data to be a list of lists, where the\n    first list contains the two integers (or string representations of\n    integers) to be summed.\n\n    Args:\n        input_data (list[list[int | str]]): A list of lists representing\n                                             the input lines. For this problem,\n                                             it's expected to be like [[A, B]].\n\n    Returns:\n        list[list[int]]: A nested list containing a single element, which is\n                         the sum of the two input integers. Example: [[9]].\n    \"\"\"\n    a = int(input_data[0][0])\n    b = int(input_data[0][1])\n    result = a + b\n    return [[result]]\n\n```",
