The function should compute the sum of two integers provided in the first sublist and return the result in the specified format. The solution involves extracting the two integers from the first sublist, calculating their sum, and returning the result as a list of lists.\n\n**Modifications:**\n\nNo modifications were necessary as the provided code was already correct and properly formatted.\n\n**Python Code:**\n\n```python\n# filename: codebase/solution.py\ndef main_function(input_data: list[list[int | str]]):\n    # Extract the two integers from the first sublist\n    A, B = input_data[0]\n    \n    # Calculate their sum\n    result = A + B\n    \n    # Return the result in the required format\n    return [[result]]\n```",
